# Overview

This project is designed to allow you to play Ultimate Tic Tac Toe, along with normal Tic Tac Toe. If you don't know what Ultimate Tic Tac Toe is, there is a website provide below that explains it. The project contains two classes, the TicTacToeBoard class and the UltimateTicTacToeBoard. The UltimateTicTacToeBoard inherits the TicTacToeBoard class. Using just these classes you can play Ultimate Tic Tac Toe and regular Tic Tac Toe.

The purpose for writing this software was to familiarize myself with the Kotlin programming language.

Here is a video demostrating my project.
